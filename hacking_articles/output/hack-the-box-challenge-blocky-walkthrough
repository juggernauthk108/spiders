									Hello friends!! Today we are going to solve another CTF challenge “Blocky ” which is available online for those who want to increase their skill penetration testing and black box testing. Blocky is a retried vulnerable lab presented by Hack the Box for making online penetration practices according to your experience level, they have a collection of vulnerable labs as challenges from beginners to Expert level. We are going to start a new series of hack the box beginning with Blocky craft which is designed for beginners.
Since these labs are online available therefore they have static IP and IP of blocky is 10.10.10.37 so let’s begin with nmap port enumeration.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -sV 10.10.10.37
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -sV 10.10.10.37
					
				
			
		

From the given below image, you can observe we found port 21, 22, 80 are open in the victim’s network.

Knowing port 80 is open in victim’s network I preferred to explore his IP in the browser but didn’t get any remarkable clue on its welcome page for the next step.

Next, we use the dirb tool of kali to enumerate the directories and found some important directories such as /phpmyadmin, /wp-admin, /plugin/files and etc which you can confirm from below image.

		
		
			
			
			
			
dirb http://10.10.10.37
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						dirb http://10.10.10.37
					
				
			
		


After browsing so many directories I found plugin/files a bit interested by executing the following URL in the browser.

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://10.10.10.37/plugins/files
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://10.10.10.37/plugins/files
					
				
			
		

From given below image you can observe that it has shown two jar file. Let’s download BlockyCore.jar file and then move for its compilation.

Using online compilers I had complied blockycore.jar file and found something very interesting in it. It contains login credential sqluser and sqlpass as highlighted in below image.

Then I explore http://10.10.10.37/phpmyadmin and login into phpmyadmin server using above credential 

		
		
			
			
			
			
root: 8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						root: 8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22
					
				
			
		


Then opened the WordPress database for stealing username from here and I found a user login: Notch with user Id 1.

Now I try to access victim’s system PTs shell through SSH since port 22 is open as per nmap result and I had also found a user name, therefore, I open a new terminal in kali executed following command to connecting with target network through ssh service.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ssh notch@10.10.10.37
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ssh notch@10.10.10.37
					
				
			
		

For password, I try above password found in the jar file and got successful login into victims shell.
id
From id result, I came to know Notch is the first user of the system.

By executing sudo -l command it tells us that user Notch has full privileged in this machine.

Then I moved for root access using the previous same password and again I get root access successfully.

		
		
			
			
			
			
sudo su
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sudo su
					
				
			
		

Then inside its home directory, I found the user.txt file and used cat command for reading this file.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ls
cat user.txt
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						lscat user.txt
					
				
			
		

Gracefully!! We found the 1st flag of this Lab in user.txt

Then I moved into root directory where I found root.txt and again use cat command for reading this file.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /root
ls
cat root.txt
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						cd /rootlscat root.txt
					
				
			
		

Great!!! We completed this challenge by capturing the 2nd flag in the root.txt file.
