									Hello friends! Today we are going to take another boot2root challenge known as “unknowndevice64: 1”. The credit for making this VM machine goes to “Ajay Verma” and it is another boot2root challenge in which our goal is to get root access to complete the challenge. You can download this VM here.
Security Level: Beginner
Penetrating Methodology:

IP Discovery using netdiscover
Network scanning (Nmap)
Surfing HTTP service port
Finding image File
Extracting the hidden file from the image
Logging in through SSH
Escaping restricted shell
Finding binary in sudoers list
Getting the root shell and finding the flag

Walkthrough
Let’s start off with scanning the network to find our target.

		
		
			
			
			
			
netdiscover
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						netdiscover
					
				
			
		


We found our target –&gt; 192.168.1.104
Our next step is to scan our target with nmap.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -sV 192.168.1.104
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -sV 192.168.1.104
					
				
			
		


The NMAP output shows us that there are 2 ports open: 1337(SSH), 31337(HTTP)
We find that port 31337 is running HTTP, so we open the IP in our browser. Here we find a string “h1dd3n” that might be a hint or a password for something.

We take a look at the source code of the web page and inside a comment, we find a string called “key_is_h1dd3n.jpg”.

We open the image in our browser and download it in our system.

After downloading the image, we use steghide to extract any hidden file from the image. When we try to extract files using steghide, it prompts for a password. We use the password “h1dd3n” we found earlier on the webpage and were successfully able to extract a text file. We take a look at the content of the text file and find a brain fuck encoded string.

		
		
			
			
			
			
steghide extract -sf key_is_h1dd3n.jpg
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						steghide extract -sf key_is_h1dd3n.jpg
					
				
			
		


We decode the brainfuck encoded string using this site and find a username and password.

		
		
			
			
			
			
Username: ud64
Password: 1M!#64@ud
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						Username: ud64Password: 1M!#[email protected]
					
				
			
		


As port 1337 is running SSH, we use the credentials we found above to log in. After logging in through SSH we find that we have a restricted shell, and PATH and SHELL environment variable are read-only.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ssh ud64@192.168.1.104 -p 1337
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						ssh ud64@192.168.1.104 -p 1337
					
				
			
		


After pressing the “tab” button twice, we find the commands we can run using the restricted shell. Among that command, we find that we can use the Vi editor. We use Vi editor to escape the restricted shell.

		
		
			
			
			
			
:!/bin/bash
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						:!/bin/bash
					
				
			
		


After escaping the restricted shell, we export “/bin/bash” as our SHELL environment variable and “/usr/bin” as our PATH environment variable so that we can run Linux commands properly. Now we check sudoers list and find we can run “/usr/bin/sysud64” as root without a password.

		
		
			
			
			
			
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
export SHELL=/bin/bash:$SHELL
sudo -l
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATHexport SHELL=/bin/bash:$SHELLsudo -l
					
				
			
		


On checking the help for “sysud64”, we find that it is actually executing strace.

		
		
			
			
			
			
sudo sysud64 -h | less
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sudo sysud64 -h | less
					
				
			
		


As we can run sysud64 as root and sysud64 are actually running the strace command. We can spawn a shell as root user using “sysud64”. After spawning a shell as the root user, we switch to the root directory and

		
		
			
			
			
			
sudo sysud64 -o /dev/null /bin/sh
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sudo sysud64 -o /dev/null /bin/sh

								Stage 1 of your description is incorrect.  Great blog, am always looking to learn, but this very small error, leads to a lot of other research to open the “key_is_h1dd3n.jpg”.  If this was your intention, it worked, however the passphrase is not what you have on the instructions.
