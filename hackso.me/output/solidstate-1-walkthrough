This post documents the complete walkthrough of SolidState: 1, a boot2root VM created by Ch33z_plz, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Itâs originally created for HackTheBox.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.20.130

nmap finds a couple of open ports. JAMES 2.3.2 sure brings back memories.

Heck. This is screwed up.



Letâs list down the users with listusers.



I have an evil idea. Letâs change all the usersâ password to their usernames.



Reading Otherâs Emails
Now that I have changed all the passwords, I can log in to their POP3 account to read their emails.



You can see that James asked John to send Mindy a temporary password for SSH access.



Letâs see if the password is valid.
Low-Privilege Shell



The password works but we have a small problem.



Bypass Restricted Shell
This is almost trivial to bypass. We know SSH allows us to execute commands upon login. With this in mind, we can do something like this.



Privilege Escalation
During enumeration of mindyâs account, I found a world-writable file /opt/tmp.py. Hereâs how it looks like.



If I had to guess, I would say this is run by crontab under rootâs account. Letâs replace it with something special. 



About three minutes later, a root shell appears.



Whatâs the Flag?




Afterthought
Hereâs the userâs flag for completeness sake.
