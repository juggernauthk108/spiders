This post documents the easiest walkthrough of BSides Vancouver: 2018 (Workshop), a boot2root VM created by abatchy, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
This VM aims to create a safe environment to perform real-world penetration testing on an intentionally vulnerable target. As the name implied, the VM appeared as course material in a workshop during 2018 BSides Vancouver.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.30.129
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 64 vsftpd 2.3.5

nmap finds 21/tcp, 22/tcp, and 80/tcp open. None of the services are vulnerable to any remote code execution attacks right off the bat. Letâs explore the ftp service next since we can log in anonymously.
FTP Service
Thereâs a file users.txt.bk in the public directoryâit contains usernames.
# cat users.txt.bk
abatchy
john
mai
anne
doomguy

SSH Service
If I had to guess, I would say these are probably users with an account in the target. Letâs find out.

As you can see, anne is the sole account that can login via SSH with a password. This calls for a brute-force attack.
Hail Hydra
For online brute-force attack, I like to use hydra and the rockyou wordlist. Hereâs the command.
# hydra -l anne -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f -e nsr -o hydra.txt -t 4 ssh://192.168.30.129
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.30.129   login: anne   password: princess

SSH Access
I donât believe itâthis is way too easy.

Privilege Escalation
Guess what? anne is able to sudo as root.

Eyes on the Prize
I got my eyes on the prize.

Afterthought
Admittedly, this VM is not too difficult since itâs targeting delegates attending the workshop. Thatâs also the reason why there are other ways to gain remote access and rooting the VM because the instructor would then cover other attack surfaces like WordPress and/or kernel exploit during the workshop.
