This post documents the complete walkthrough of Blacklight: 1, a CTF-style VM created by Carter, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Thereâs no description for this one. In a way, itâs good because you donât know what to expect, and it kinda raises the fun factor.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.30.129
...

nmap finds two open ports: 80/tcp and 9072/tcp. The second port is interesting. I used nc to connect to it. At first, I thought this is a remote shell. The port closed after two failed attempts to provide any meaningful instructions.

That leaves me with 80/tcp to explore.

Thank you for the reassurance, Carter.
Directory/File Enumeration
Time for some fuzzing. Letâs use gobuster with common.txt from SecLists.

Hmm. robots.txt is available. Why didnât nmap pick this up?

Oh, the robots.txt is a non-conforming one. Also, the file blacklight.dict appears to be a wordlist.
Flag: 1
The first flag is as follows.

9072 is the open port found by nmap earlier. Whatâs the deal about âthe secret is at homeâ?
Reverse Shell
Although Iâve closed the port with my silly attempts, I always create a snapshot when the VM is first online. That way, even if I do anything stupid, I can always revert the snapshot.
Letâs revert the snapshot and focus on 9072/tcp this time, keeping in mind I have two attempts before the port closed on me for good.

To be honest, Iâve no idea what the hash is for. Itâs a SHA256 hash. Iâve also tried using the wordlist blacklight.dict to crack it, but to no avail. Nonetheless, all we have left is the .exec command. It better yield something! 
A couple of reverts laterâ¦
I found the right command to run thatâll give me a shell. A root shell no less!
On the BLACKLIGHT console mk1

On my nc listener

Whereâs the Secret?


Flag: 2
This is how flag2-inside.jpg looks like.

The hint is strong in this one.

Outguess is a universal steganographic tool that allows the insertion of hidden information into the redundant bits of data sources.

Another hint is at /root/.bash_history.

To retrieve flag 2, use the following commond.

You thought this is the end, didnât you?
Flag: 3


Afterthought
This VM is a little different. The story doesnât end with a root shell. Rather, itâs a CTF. As such, the story ends when youâve captured all the flags.

Well-played, Carter, well-playedâ¦
